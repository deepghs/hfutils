This module provides functionality for handling RAR archives.

It includes functions for unpacking RAR files and a placeholder for packing (which is not supported).
The module uses the 'rarfile' library for RAR file operations.

.. note::
    The 'rarfile' library is optional. If not installed, RAR functionality will be limited.
